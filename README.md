# QHAM21_project
In this work I have provided a review of the work presented by N.Miller et al. on Quantum Hopfield Associative Memory (QHAM) \small{\cite{QHAM}}, along with a brief overview of various methods of implementing quantum neural networks. I have discussed the results to some of the experiments that I have conducted on my own implementation of the QHAM .
